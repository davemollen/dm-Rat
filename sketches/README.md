# FIR filter

The FIR filter tables for oversampling are generated with [this python code](./fir.py).

1. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Change the oversampling variable to the oversampling factor you'd like.
3. Run the script `python3 ./fir.py`. The FIR filter table coefficients are then logged on your console.
