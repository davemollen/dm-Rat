## VST3 and CLAP installation

You can download the VST3 and CLAP plugins for Linux, Windows and macOS from the [releases page](https://github.com/davemollen/dm-Rat/releases).

On macOS you may need to [disable Gatekeeper](https://disable-gatekeeper.github.io/) as Apple has recently made it more difficult to run unsigned code on macOS.

If you want to build the plugin on your own machine check out the [nih-plug repository](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/nih-plug) for instructions.

## MOD installation

Install the plugin from the MOD Audio plugin store.

The latest MOD builds can also be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/davemollen/dm-Rat/releases).

If you want to build the plugin on your own machine check out the [mod-plugin-builder repository](https://github.com/moddevices/mod-plugin-builder) for instructions.

## MOD Desktop installation

You can download the MOD Desktop lv2 plugin for Linux, Windows and macOS from the [releases page](https://github.com/davemollen/dm-Rat/releases). You can use the plugin in other lv2 hosts too, but you'll only have a GUI on MOD Desktop.
